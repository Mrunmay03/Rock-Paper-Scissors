# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Python is a multipurpose language and one can do anything with it. Python can also be used for game development. Letâ€™s create a simple command-line Rock-Paper-Scissor game. In this game, the user gets the first chance to pick the option between Rock, paper, and scissors. After the computer selects from the remaining two choices(randomly), the winner is decided as per the rules.
A rock paper scissors game is considered a hand game between two or more players. Participants say "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" and then form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended) in a simultaneous manner.

The rules of this game are simple:

Rule 1: Rock smashes scissors, so rock wins
Rule 2: Paper covers rock, so paper wins
Rule 3: Scissors cut paper, so scissors win
